## **About Space Buff**
Space buff is my attempt at creating a public, free of use space API, which can be used with ease. I don't like many of the options out there right now, and as I've taken an interest to making cool apps revolving around space, I thought making a public API would be a fun and creative way to do all correctly, and get involved with the community.

This specific repository is for the amazon alexa skill, which will interact with the API. I Thought it would be a good entry point to alexa development.

## **Contributions**
* **API Development**
  * Anyone who is excited enough about the idea of making a better repository of space information, for free use on multiple platforms, is welcome to contribute. I'm starting development on a [Swift](http://github.com/apple/swift) server now using the [Vapor](http://github.com/vapor/vapor) framework. _For now, though, everything is locally stored as a JSON in the [/sources](http://github.com/charliekenney23/spaceBuff_skill/sources) directory (as I just started this ambitous project, and this part is a whole seperate project in itself)._ The project will be hosted [here](http://github.com/charliekenney23/spaceBuff_API).
* **Design**
  * Anyone with sick design skills would be appriciated. As you may have already seen, the [icons](http://github.com/charliekenney23/spaceBuff_skill/media) I've created suck. I will most likely change them before too long as it is just terrible.
